# Walmart Sales Dip Analysis – Root Cause Case Study

This project investigates **why Walmart experiences sharp sales dips after holiday peaks** (Christmas → January).  
Using the Walmart dataset, I performed **root cause analysis**, built insights with Python & Power BI, and summarized findings in a boardroom-ready presentation.

## Problem Statement
Walmart sees strong spikes in holiday sales, but **January sales consistently drop** by ~50%.  
Goal: Identify **root causes** and recommend **business actions**.

---

## Key Insights
- Sales are stable at ~$40–50M per week with sharp holiday spikes (Super Bowl, Thanksgiving, Christmas).  
- **Post-holiday dips** are structural: –41.3M in 2023, –37.2M in 2024.  
- **Departments hit hardest**: Toys (Dept 1), Seasonal Goods (Dept 72), Apparel (Dept 5).  
- **Store Types B & C** show sharper % declines vs Type A.  
- **Drivers**: Promotions collapsed (markdowns = 0), CPI ↑ slightly, Unemployment ↓ (not a factor).

## Recommendations
1. **Smooth Promotions** – maintain baseline markdowns in high-elasticity categories.  
2. **Diversify Beyond Seasonal** – push grocery, household, and essentials in January.  
3. **Target Store Types B & C** – tailored post-holiday promotions.  
4. **Value Messaging** – bundles, own-label, loyalty offers.  
5. **Dashboard Monitoring** – Power BI alerts for abnormal dips.

## Deliverables
- [Presentation (PPTX)](Presentation1.pptx) – Executive slides  
- Python Notebook – Root cause analysis & charts  

---

## Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- GitHub for portfolio publication

This project demonstrates **business storytelling with data** — turning raw analysis into insights & actions that leadership can use.
